## Utility

$FOMO serves as the utility token powering the FOMO FEVER platform. Its primary use cases:

### Trust Tier Verification

Token projects burn $FOMO to earn trust tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold), which provide FOMO score multipliers and credibility badges on the platform.

### Profile Claiming

Projects burn $FOMO to unlock profile customization features including logo, banner, description, and social links.

### Ranking Boosts

Verified tokens receive score multipliers (1.05x to 1.25x) applied to their base FOMO score, improving their visibility in trending lists and search results.

## Deflationary Mechanism

Every $FOMO burn is permanent and irreversible:

* Tokens are sent to a Solana burn address
* Each burn is verified on-chain by the platform backend
* Burn transactions are recorded in the platform database
* Total burned amounts are publicly displayed per token profile

As more projects verify through the Trust Tier System, the total circulating supply of $FOMO decreases over time, creating natural deflationary pressure tied directly to platform adoption.

## Price Discovery

$FOMO trades on Solana DEXs following its Pump.fun graduation. Real-time pricing is sourced from Birdeye API and used to calculate USD-denominated burn thresholds for trust tier upgrades.

# FOMO FEVER Whitepaper

**Version 1.0 — February 2026**

## Abstract

FOMO FEVER is a Solana-native intelligence platform that surfaces real-time market signals, AI-driven analysis, and on-chain safety verification for meme tokens. By combining quantitative scoring with community sentiment and a deflationary burn-to-verify trust system, FOMO FEVER provides retail participants with the context they need to navigate the fast-moving meme token landscape.

The platform's native token, **$FOMO**, serves as the utility token that powers the Trust Tier System — a burn-based verification layer where token projects burn $FOMO to earn elevated trust status and ranking boosts.

# Problem Statement

The Solana meme token ecosystem launches thousands of new tokens weekly across platforms like Pump.fun, LetsBonk, and Bags.fm. Participants face three core challenges:

## Signal Overload

Too many tokens, no way to quickly assess which have real momentum versus manufactured hype. New tokens appear every minute, and most participants lack the tools to filter noise from genuine market signals.

## Rug Pull Risk

Many tokens launch with mutable authorities, concentrated holder distributions, or no locked liquidity, putting participant funds at risk. Without on-chain verification, there is no way to distinguish legitimate projects from potential scams.

## Information Asymmetry

Insiders and bots have access to on-chain data that retail participants cannot easily interpret in real time. This creates an uneven playing field where informed actors can exploit those without access to the same intelligence.
